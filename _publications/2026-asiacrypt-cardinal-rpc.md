Masking is a standard countermeasure against side-channel attacks on embedded
cryptographic implementations. Its security is commonly analyzed in the random
probing model, which offers a useful trade-off between realistic leakage
assumptions and tractable security proofs. Recent years have seen the emergence
of several masking compilers based on compositional security frameworks such as
general/cardinal random probing composability (RPC). Most of these approaches
rely on dedicated refresh gadgets whose structure is often tightly coupled to
the targeted security analysis.

In this work, we investigate the impact of refresh gadgets on the random probing
security of masking compilers within the recent general/cardinal RPC
frameworks. We formalize two broad families of refresh gadgets, namely direct
and zero encoding-based refreshes, define ideal constructions for both families
under explicit randomness and uniformity conditions, and extend the
compositional analysis of zero encoding-based refreshes.
    
We then introduce an atomic refresh function capturing the core operation
underlying most refresh gadgets from the literature. This abstraction allows us
to express and analyze existing constructions within a unified framework, derive
their cardinal/general RPC envelopes, and obtain analytical formulas for several
of them. Finally, we compare ideal and concrete refresh gadgets on masked
implementations of AES and Raccoon. Our results provide a systematic comparison
of the security-complexity trade-offs achieved by current refresh strategies.
