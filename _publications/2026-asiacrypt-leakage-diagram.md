Masking is a widely used countermeasure against side-channel attacks, where
sensitive variables are split into randomized shares in order to prevent
information leakage from intermediate computations. Its security is commonly
analyzed in the random probing model, in which each internal variable leaks
independently with some probability *p*. Constructing large masked circuits that
achieve random probing security (RPS) is challenging, and a common approach is
to rely on composability frameworks ensuring that suitable local gadget-level
properties imply circuit-level guarantees.

Recent works have introduced compositional frameworks based on leakage diagrams
to derive security guarantees in the random probing model. While elegant and
scalable, these approaches rely on conservative analyses and security proofs
tailored to specific gadget constructions.

In this work, we revisit and refine a leakage-diagram approach published in
TCHES 2023. We formalize and generalize the proof to show that the probability
of an orbit in the leakage diagram upper bounds the adversary's RPS advantage.
Our analysis identifies the local gadget-level conditions needed for this
composition result, refines the analysis of edge inclusion probabilities in
leakage diagrams for the underlying multiplication gadgets, leading to tighter
final security bounds, and improves the combinatorial analysis of orbits through
a detailed study of small cases and new structural properties for larger ones.

We evaluate the resulting constructions on AES. Our results significantly
improve the concrete security guarantees compared to previous leakage diagram
analyses, while also improving the randomness complexity compared to existing
composable approaches.
